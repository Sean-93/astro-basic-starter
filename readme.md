# ASTRO WEB FRAMEWORK SIMPLE STARTER TEMPLATE

Astro is a web framework that is performant, user-friendly, and elegant. I made this Astro website starter because it's my go-to setup for Astro projects. It includes:

- Astro Tailwind CSS integration: [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
- Astro sitemap integration: [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/)
- Integration of Google Material Icons: [https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons#setup_method_1_using_via_google_fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons#setup_method_1_using_via_google_fonts)
- Integration of Google Fonts: [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Structured metadata setup for improved SEO (see header in layout file)
- Added navbar and footer components
